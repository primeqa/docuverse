Syntax aclput [ -i inAclFile ] [ -R ] [ -t acl_type ] [ -v ]FileObject Description The aclput command sets the access control information of the file object that is specified by the FileObject parameter. The command reads standard input for the access control information, unless you specify the -i flag. Note: If you are reading from standard input your entries must match the expected format of the access control information or you get an error message. Use the Ctrl-D key sequence to complete the session. Access Control List Access Control Lists form the core of protection for file system objects. Each file system object is uniquely associated with one piece of data, called ACL that defines the access rights to the object. ACL might consist of multiple Access Control Entries (ACEs), each defining one particular set of access rights for a user. Typically, ACE consists of information such as identification (to whom this ACE applies) and access rights (allow-read, deny-write). ACE might also capture information such as inheritance flags and alarm and audit flags. The format and enforcement of ACL data is entirely dependent on the ACL type in which they are defined. AIXÂ® provides for existence of multiple ACL types on the operating system. The list of ACLs supported by a file system instance depends on the physical file system implementation for that file system instance. Flags Table 1. Flags Item Description -i inAclFile Specifies the input file for access control information. If the access control information in the file that is specified by the InAclFile parameter is not correct, when you try to apply it to a file, an error message that is preceded by an asterisk is added to the input file. Note: The size of the ACL information depends on the ACL type. -R Apply ACL to this directory and its children file system objects recursively. -t ACL_type Specifies the ACL type of the ACL information that is displayed. If option is not provided, the actual ACL data in its original ACL type is displayed. The supported ACL types are ACLX and NFS4. -v Verbose option. This option displays many comment lines as part of the ACL data display. This comment might help in understanding the details of complex ACL types. Security Access Control This command should be a standard user program and have the trusted computing base attribute. Auditing Events If the auditing subsystem is properly configured and is enabled, the aclput command generates the following audit record or event every time the command is run: Event Information FILE_WriteXacl Modification to access controls. RBAC users Attention RBAC users: This command can perform privileged operations. Only privileged users can run privileged operations. For more information about authorizations and privileges, see Privileged Command Database in Security. For a list of privileges and the authorizations that are associated with this command, see the lssecattr command or the getcmdattr subcommand. Examples To set the access control information for the status file with information from standard input, enter: aclput status attributes: SUID and then press the Ctrl-D sequence to exit the session. To set the access control information for the status file with information stored in the acldefs file, enter: aclput -i acldefs status To set the access control information for the status file with the same information used for the plans file, enter: aclget plans | aclput status To set the access control information for the status file with an edited version of the access control information for the plans file, you must enter two commands. First, enter: aclget -o acl plans This stores the access control information for the plans file in the acl file. Edit the information in the acl file by using your favorite editor. Then, enter: aclput -i acl status This second command takes the access control information in the acl file and puts it on the status file. Files Table 2.

Normally, software requiring run-time licenses is only selected for installation when you have a license to use that software. Although the System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) allow you to install licensed software even if you do not own a license, you might be prevented from using the newly installed software until you have obtained the appropriate license. Accepting software license agreements requires that the license agreement be accepted as part of the installation process. If software installed as part of your BOS installation requires accepting a software license agreement, you cannot exit the Configuration Assistant (or the Installation Assistant for non-graphics consoles) until the license agreement has been accepted. You can view as well as accept the license agreement. The BOS installation can be customized to automatically accept software licenses. For more information, refer to Customizing your installation . For optional software installation, you can preview the license agreements on the installation media using the smit license_on_media fast path or the installp -El command. During the installation process, you can use the menu item to accept the software license, or you can use the installp command with the -Y flag. To view accepted license agreements on a system, you can use the SMIT smit installed_license fast path or the lslpp -E command. When a product is uninstalled, the license agreement acceptance is changed to the inactive state. If the product is reinstalled, you will not be prompted to reaccept the license agreement.

      "{'title': 'Using response files with NIM', '_id': '5', 'text': 'Using response files with NIM If you are using NIM to install an ISMP-packaged product on one or more NIM clients, you can create and use a separate response file for each client. Separate response files are useful when properties of the installation operation must be configured differently for each client. In order to install multiple clients, you must name each response file CLIENT_NAME.response. These response files must be located in the default location (the same location as the product installer files). For example, to install the MyProduct ISMP-packaged product located in an lpp_source resource in the /export/lpp_source/lpp_source1/ismp/ppc/MyProduct directory on the CLIENT1 and CLIENT2 clients, do the following: Create a CLIENT1.response and CLIENT2.response response file. Place the response files in the /export/lpp_source/lpp_source1/ismp/ppc/MyProduct directory. Create the correct responses for each client in the corresponding response file. When you run the NIM cust operation to install the MyProduct ISMP-packaged product on CLIENT1 and CLIENT2, the response files are used automatically and appropriately for each client. If you want to use the same response file for all clients, name the response file PRODUCT_NAME.response and place in the same default location as the ISMP-packaged product (the product location in the lpp_source resource). For example, create a response file called MyProduct.response in the /export/lpp_source/lpp_source1/ismp/ppc/MyProduct/ directory.

Figure 4. 7063-CR2 (p9) port locations and definitions For IMC and TSSC ensure that the library power and the frame power are present respectively. TheTSSC only has power when the TS4500 is powered on. If the TS4500 is not powered on, complete the following steps to power on the library: Access the display panel on the base frame of the library and slide the plastic cover upwards that protects the power button. Press the power button and make-sure that the green power indicator turn on and stay on. If not, contact your IBM service representative. When you power on the library, it runs an initialization sequence for about 2 minutes. During that time the TS4500 management GUI is not available. When the TSSC completes the power on process the TS4500 management GUI is displayed on a web browser in kiosk mode on the side library monitor. Kiosk mode means that the menu bar, address bar, and stop and reload buttons of the browser are disabled. Switch from the TS4500 GUI to the TSSC GUI by closing the web browser. If the monitor presents the TSSC login screen at startup, this is an indication of a bad connection between the IMC and the library LCC. Note: This can happen if the library is not ready to communicate before the PC. To resolve the issue, power cycle the PC that uses the GUI. If it continues to fail to start the kiosk mode, this is an indication of a problem. Power on the TSSC/IMC Locate the power button for the TSSC/IMC.

       " 'text': 'aclput Command Purpose Sets the access control information of a file. Syntax aclput [ -i inAclFile ] [ -R ] [ -t acl_type ] [ -v ]FileObject Description The aclput command sets the access control information of the file object that is specified by the FileObject parameter. The command reads standard input for the access control information, unless you specify the -i flag. Note: If you are reading from standard input your entries must match the expected format of the access control information or you get an error message. Use the Ctrl-D key sequence to complete the session. Access Control List Access Control Lists form the core of protection for file system objects. Each file system object is uniquely associated with one piece of data, called ACL that defines the access rights to the object. ACL might consist of multiple Access Control Entries (ACEs), each defining one particular set of access rights for a user. Typically, ACE consists of information such as identification (to whom this ACE applies) and access rights (allow-read, deny-write). ACE might also capture information such as inheritance flags and alarm and audit flags. The format and enforcement of ACL data is entirely dependent on the ACL type in which they are defined. AIXÂ® provides for existence of multiple ACL types on the operating system. The list of ACLs supported by a file system instance depends on the physical file system implementation for that file system instance. Flags Table 1. Flags Item Description -i inAclFile Specifies the input file for access control information. If the access control information in the file that is specified by the InAclFile parameter is not correct, when you try to apply it to a file, an error message that is preceded by an asterisk is added to the input file. Note: The size of the ACL information depends on the ACL type. -R Apply ACL to this directory and its children file system objects recursively. -t ACL_type Specifies the ACL type of the ACL information that is displayed. If option is not provided, the actual ACL data in its original ACL type is displayed. The supported ACL types are ACLX and NFS4. -v Verbose option. This option displays many comment lines as part of the ACL data display. This comment might help in understanding the details of complex ACL types. Security Access Control This command should be a standard user program and have the trusted computing base attribute. Auditing Events If the auditing subsystem is properly configured and is enabled, the aclput command generates the following audit record or event every time the command is run: Event Information FILE_WriteXacl Modification to access controls. RBAC users Attention RBAC users: This command can perform privileged operations. Only privileged users can run privileged operations. For more information about authorizations and privileges, see Privileged Command Database in Security. For a list of privileges and the authorizations that are associated with this command, see the lssecattr command or the getcmdattr subcommand. Examples To set the access control information for the status file with information from standard input, enter: aclput status attributes: SUID and then press the Ctrl-D sequence to exit the session. To set the access control information for the status file with information stored in the acldefs file, enter: aclput -i acldefs status To set the access control information for the status file with the same information used for the plans file, enter: aclget plans | aclput status To set the access control information for the status file with an edited version of the access control information for the plans file, you must enter two commands. First, enter: aclget -o acl plans This stores the access control information for the plans file in the acl file. Edit the information in the acl file by using your favorite editor. Then, enter: aclput -i acl status This second command takes the access control information in the acl file and puts it on the status file. Files Table 2.
