    A model for cross-encoder tasks, designed to compute similarity scores

    Provides methods to initialize a cross-encoder model with a specified
    pre-trained transformer model and compute similarity scores between
    pairs of inputs. The model uses AutoModelForSequenceClassification for
    sequence classification tasks and supports tokenization for input pairs.

    Attributes:
    model : Pre-trained transformer model for sequence classification.
    tokenizer : Tokenizer associated with the model for input processing.
